A simple UI to simulate results of an election based on the [direct proportional to the largest remainder](https://github.com/seba1204/voting-simulation.git) method (see here for French [wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrutin_proportionnel_plurinominal#M%C3%A9thode_utilisant_le_quotient_de_Hare)).
